### What is Controversy alerts feature?

This feature is a part often alerting system for GaiaLens main application. It controls the sending of emails to users based on different controversies triggers and maintains an email queue.

### How it works?

The main functionality can be summarized as follows:

1. **Email Queue Management**: The script checks if there are unsent emails in the queue and whether it's the appropriate time to send them (between 9 am and 5 pm). If the queue is empty and it's within the specified time frame, new emails are composed and inserted into the queue.

2. **Email Composition**: If it's the right time and the queue is empty, the system composes new emails and adds them to the queue.

3. **Email Sending**: If the queue is filled and it's the appropriate time, emails are sent to the recipients.

4. **Logging and Updating**: Sent emails are logged for future reference, and the queue is updated to mark the sent emails.

5. **Authentication**: To trigger this process, a valid `trigger_id` and `trigger_secret` are required. These are used to authenticate the request and ensure that only a cron job (or a similar automated process) can trigger the function.

6. **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling measures. If an error occurs at any stage of the process, an error message is sent to a support email address for further investigation.

Planned features for version V1.1 include support for generic types (subscriptions_types), storing the trigger id in the queue log, adding a trigger type table to the database, and adjusting trigger times from a dashboard.

    Server->>EmailService: Send emails
    EmailService-->>Server: Return email send response
    Server->>Database: Parse email response, insert into log and update queue table
    Server-->>GCP cron: Return response
```

The feature  is a part of an automated email notification system. It's responsible for composing, queuing, and sending emails to users based on specific triggers. It's used in situations where applications need to notify users about controversies related to companies, and in the future will be used to updates, and send alerts regarding news, ESG information and more.

This feature is designed to function within a specific timeframe (9 am to 5 pm), manage the email queue (add new emails when the queue is empty, and send them when it's time), and handle errors that might occur in the process.

It's also designed to ensure security and integrity by requiring specific authentication (using a trigger_id and trigger_secret) to activate the email notification process. This prevents unauthorized users from triggering the email sending process.

In addition to this, the feature logs sent emails and updates the queue status. Future enhancements of this feature plan to include support for generic types, storing trigger id in the queue log, adding a trigger type table to the database, and making trigger times adjustable from a dashboard.
