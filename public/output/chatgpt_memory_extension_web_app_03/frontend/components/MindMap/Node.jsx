// Sure, here's the code implementation for Node.jsx

```
import React from 'react';

const Node = ({ title, description, children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="node">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{description}</p>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Node;
``` 

This implementation exports a Node component that accepts `title`, `description`, and `children` as props. The component simply renders these props as an HTML node with a title, description, and children.
