# ChatGPT Memory Extension Web App

This project aims to simulate human memory processes to provide long-term memory support for ChatGPT, particularly when dealing with complex tasks such as coding a large application.

## Description

The ChatGPT Memory Extension Web App is a web-based application designed to help users remember key information and tasks associated with a project. It uses a variety of AI and machine learning techniques to simulate the way the human brain processes and stores information.

## Parameters

The application takes a variety of parameters, including project name, task details, due dates, and other relevant information. It also uses natural language processing techniques to extract key information from text input.

## Usage Instructions

To use the application, simply log in using your ChatGPT credentials. Once you are logged in, you can start creating projects and adding tasks to them. The application will automatically extract key information from your input and store it in a way that is easy to retrieve later.

## Examples

Here is an example of how to create a new project:

```
POST /api/projects
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "description": "A description of my project"
}
```

Here is an example of how to add a task to a project:

```
POST /api/projects/:projectId/tasks
{
  "name": "My Task",
  "description": "A description of my task",
  "dueDate": "2022-01-01"
}
```

## Target Audience

The ChatGPT Memory Extension Web App is designed for anyone who needs help remembering key information associated with a project. It is particularly useful for people working on complex projects with many different tasks and deadlines.
