// Sure, here's an implementation of dashboard.jsx:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const user = useSelector(state => state.user);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to your dashboard, {user.name}!</h1>
      <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
      <p>Subscription status: {user.subscription}</p>
      {/* Additional dashboard content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Dashboard;
```

Note: This implementation assumes that the user data is stored in the Redux store. The `useSelector` hook is used to retrieve the user data from the store.
