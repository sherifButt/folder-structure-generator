Here's an example implementation of [id].jsx:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function MindMapPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Mind Map Page {id}</h1>
      {/* Add your mind map component here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation imports React and the `useRouter` hook from Next.js. It exports a default React component called `MindMapPage`. 

The `useRouter` hook is used to get the value of the `id` parameter from the route query. This value is then used in the component to render the appropriate mind map.

Note that this implementation does not include any actual mind map component code - this will need to be added separately.
