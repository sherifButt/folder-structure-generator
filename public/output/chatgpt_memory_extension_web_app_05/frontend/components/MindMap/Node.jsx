// Sure, here's an implementation of Node.jsx file.

```
import React from 'react';

const Node = ({ node }) => {
  return (
    <div className="node">
      <p>{node.title}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Node;
``` 

This is a basic implementation of Node component that takes a `node` object as a prop and displays its `title` as a paragraph within a div with a class name of `node`.
