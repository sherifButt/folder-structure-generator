Sure, here's an example README.md file for the ChatGPT Memory Extension Web App:

# ChatGPT Memory Extension Web App

This project aims to simulate human memory processes to provide long-term memory support for ChatGPT, particularly when dealing with complex tasks such as coding a large application.

## Dependencies

To set up your development environment, install the following dependencies: Nextjs, NextAuth, Stripe, Redux RTK Query, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Express, and Swagger. You can do this with the command: `npm install next next-auth stripe @reduxjs/toolkit tailwindcss pg express swagger-ui-express`.

## Implementation

The implementation will involve setting up a Nextjs frontend with NextAuth for authentication, Redux RTK Query for state management, and Tailwind for styling. The backend will be built on Express with PostgreSQL for data persistence. API documentation will be handled by Swagger.

The file structure will be as follows: `ChatGPT-Memory-Extension-Web-App/{frontend/{components, pages, redux, public, styles}, backend/{controllers, middlewares, models, routes}, package.json, README.md}`.

Key features of the app include Input Processing, Title and Description Extraction, Hierarchical Feature Breakdown, Recursive Feature Decomposition, Task List Generation, Mind Map Storage, Context-aware Query Mechanism, Retrieval and Updating Mechanism, Automatic Pruning and Forgetting, and Integration with ChatGPT.

## Usage

To use the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChatGPT-Memory-Extension-Web-App.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Examples

Here are some examples of how the app can be used:

1. A user is working on a complex coding project and needs to keep track of various tasks and subtasks. They use the app to generate a task list and mind map to help them stay organized.
2. A user is studying for an exam and needs to remember a large amount of information. They use the app to break down the information into smaller, more manageable pieces and store it in a hierarchical structure.
3. A user is planning a trip and needs to keep track of various details such as flights, accommodations, and activities. They use the app to store this information in a context-aware manner, allowing them to easily retrieve and update it as needed.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this app includes anyone who needs help with long-term memory support, particularly when dealing with complex tasks or large amounts of information.
