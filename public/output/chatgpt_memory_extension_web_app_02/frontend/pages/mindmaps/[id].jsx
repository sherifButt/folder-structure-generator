import React from 'react';

export default function MindMapPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Mind Map Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The above code is a simple implementation of the dynamic route [id].jsx using React in Next.js. It exports a default React component called `MindMapPage` which returns a basic HTML structure with a heading. This is just a starting point and can be modified to display the specific mind map page based on the `id` parameter passed in the URL.
