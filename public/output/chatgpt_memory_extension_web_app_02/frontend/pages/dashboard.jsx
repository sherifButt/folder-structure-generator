// Sure, here's an implementation of dashboard.jsx:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const user = useSelector(state => state.user);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Your Dashboard, {user.name}!</h1>
      <p>Here you can view your saved mind maps, task lists, and more.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;
```

This file imports React and Redux, and exports a default functional component called `Dashboard`. It uses the `useSelector` hook to retrieve the current user from the Redux store, and displays a personalized welcome message.
