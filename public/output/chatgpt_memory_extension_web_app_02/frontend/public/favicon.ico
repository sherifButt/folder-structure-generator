As mentioned, implementing a favicon does not require any coding. It involves creating a file named "favicon.ico" and placing it in the root directory of your website. The file should be in the ICO format and should be appropriately sized for different devices. 

Here is an example of how to add a favicon to a website:

1. Create a file named "favicon.ico" with an image editor that supports the ICO format.
2. Place the file in the root directory of your website, alongside your index.html file.
3. Add the following link tag in the head section of your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
```

This will tell the browser to load the favicon.ico file as the icon for your website.
