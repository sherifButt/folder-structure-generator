Endpoint `/api/diagram` (POST) - Expects: `{jwt, diagramData}`, Returns: `{status, diagramData}`. 2. **Auth:** JWT based authentication. User roles: 'admin', 'user'. 'Admin' has all permissions, 'user' can create/edit own diagrams, view shared diagrams. 3. **Error Handling:** Application employs try-catch logic. On failure, errors are logged server-side and a generic error message is returned to the client. 4. **Business Rules:** Nodes creation limited to 100 per user. Instructions priority determined by user at creation, can be adjusted later. Nodes are only editable by the creator user. 5. **Tech Stack:** Frontend - Nextjs, tailwind, redux rtk query, react-flow , Backend - Node.js with Express, Database - PostgreSQL, Avatar API - Python Flask, Job Queue - Redis, Storage - AWS S3. 6. **Test Cases:** Unit tests for each API endpoint. Integration test for user registration-login-diagram creation flow. End-to-end tests for user journeys.",
