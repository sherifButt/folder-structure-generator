Endpoint `/api/diagram` (POST) - Expects: `{jwt, diagramData}`, Returns: `{status, diagramData}`. 2. **Auth:** JWT based authentication. User roles: 'admin', 'user'. 'Admin' has all permissions, 'user' can create/edit own diagrams, view shared diagrams. 3. **Error Handling:** Application employs try-catch logic. On failure, errors are logged server-side and a generic error message is returned to the client. 4. **Business Rules:** Nodes creation limited to 100 per user. Instructions priority determined by user at creation, can be adjusted later. Nodes are only editable by the creator user. 5. **Tech Stack:** Frontend - Nextjs, tailwind, redux rtk query, react-flow , Backend - Node.js with Express, Database - PostgreSQL, Avatar API - Python Flask, Job Queue - Redis, Storage - AWS S3. 6. **Test Cases:** Unit tests for each API endpoint. Integration test for user registration-login-diagram creation flow. End-to-end tests for user journeys.",

        "The user registers for an account, and all user details, including hashed passwords, are stored in the PostgreSQL database.The user starts a new mind map by describing the persona of the mind map manager. This information is sent to the backend, which uses AI to generate a matching avatar. The avatar data is then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.The user provides a description of the mind map and any notes. This information is sent to the backend, which uses AI to generate the initial mind map. The mind map data (as a JSON object) is then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.As the user interacts with the mind map, adding nodes, creating links, etc., these changes are sent to the backend and stored in MongoDB. This allows for the mind map to be saved and retrieved in real-time.If the user decides to share the mind map with another user, the backend handles the sharing process by providing a link to the shared mind map or directly sending an invitation to the other user's email address.If the user decides to expand a node using AI, the mind map's current context is sent to the backend, which uses OpenAI GPT to generate the expanded node. The new node(s) is then sent back to the frontend and added to the mind map.The user can also download the full context of the mind map, which is retrieved from the backend.The user can decide to use the stored mind map as a starting point for other diagrams, such as a flow chart or marketing automation diagram.",
